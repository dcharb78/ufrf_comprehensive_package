# Development Plan

**Date:** 2025-07-10 (based on README version)

**Current Task:** Read and understand the entire UFRF project, run tests to validate it runs.

**Milestones:**
1. Confirm project structure and create/update planning documents.
2. Install dependencies if needed.
3. Run quick test (ufrf-quick-test.py).
4. Run full validation (ufrf-validation-package.py).
5. Read all project files to gain comprehensive understanding.
6. Update this plan at completion with findings.

**Milestone Update:** GitHub preparation complete - Git repo initialized, .gitignore added, LICENSE.md created with CC BY-NC 4.0, README.md updated, changes committed. Ready to push to GitHub.

**Status:** Tests being rerun; will update with results.

**Next Steps:** Follow the task instructions step by step.

**Knowledge Tracking:** The project involves the Universal Field Resonance Framework (UFRF) with theoretical documents, mathematical proofs, and Python validation scripts related to Fibonacci primes, tesseracts, and harmonic principles, as per attached memories. 

**Final Update:** GitHub repository successfully created and published at https://github.com/dcharb78/ufrf_comprehensive_package.git. All files pushed including CC BY-NC 4.0 license, updated README, and complete UFRF framework. Task complete.

**New Task (Milestone):** Prepare project for GitHub - Initialize git repo, add Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license, create .gitignore, and update README.md for GitHub suitability.

**Status:** Starting preparation steps. 

**New Task (Milestone):** Update copyright, UFRF naming, and add no-crawl directives - Add Daniel Charbonneau copyright to all files, update UFRF references to "Unified Fractal Resonance Framework", and add robots.txt and meta tags to prevent AI crawling/training.

**Status:** Starting copyright and naming updates.
